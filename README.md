# speciesBounds

Very simple steps to replicate:

1. Install yices with python bindings according to instructions: https://github.com/SRI-CSL/yices2_python_bindings
2. Run `python3 bounds.py model.crn`

It will generate bounds and do a bunch of extra stuff, but it will also print out a rough visualization of the dependency graph.
